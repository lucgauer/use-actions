### useActions(actions, dispatch)

#### actions

Object containing all actions in the [Redux Thunk model](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk#motivation).

#### dispatch

The dispatch action. Take a look at [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer).

#### Examples

A classical example o usage:

* Actions
```js
// actions/foo-bar.jsx
const ACTION_TYPE = 'ACTION_TYPE';

export default argument => dispatch => {
    // [...]
    dispatch({ type: ACTION_TYPE, payload: argument });
}
```

* Container
```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'useActions';
import useActions from 'use-actions';
import * as actions from '../actions/foobar';
import reducer, { initialState } from '../reducers/foobar';

const FoobarContainer = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    const { dispatchBindedAction } = useActions(actions, dispatch);
    
    // Runs passing curried dispatch to the action
    return <button onClick={dispatchBindedAction}>Click me</button>;
};
```

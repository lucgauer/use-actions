#### actions

Object containing all actions in the [Redux Thunk model](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk#motivation).

#### Examples

A classical example o usage:


* Container
```
import { React, useReducer } from 'useActions';
import useActions from 'useActions';
import * as actions from '../actions/foobar';
import * as reducers from '../reducers/foobar';

const FoobarContainer = () => {
    const [] = useReducer(actions, dispatch);
    const { dispatchBindedAction } = useActions(actions, dispatch);
    
    // Runs passing curried dispatch to the action
    return <button onClick={dispatchBindedAction}>Click me</button>;
};
```

* Actions
```
// actions/foo-bar.jsx
const ACTION_TYPE = 'ACTION_TYPE';

export default argument => dispatch => {
    [...]
    dispatch({ type: ACTION_TYPE, payload: argument });
}
```
